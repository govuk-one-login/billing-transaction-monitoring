      Invoice within threshold (green) - the discrepancy between measured event data and the invoice is within the threshold tolerance of -1% and 1%. This invoice can be paid.
    </li>
    <li>
      Invoice above threshold (red) - the discrepancy between measured event data and the invoice is above the threshold of 1%. The vendor may have overcharged within the invoice. Contact the Data &amp; Analytics team to confirm measured data and the vendor to confirm the invoice.

    <li>
      Invoice below threshold (blue) - the discrepancy between measured event data and the invoice is below the threshold of -1%. The vendor may have undercharged within the invoice. Contact the Data &amp; Analytics team to confirm measured data and the vendor to confirm the invoice.

    <li>Invoice and events missing - There is no invoices or event data for this month.</li>
    <li>
      Invoice missing - An event has been measured for this month, but there has been no corresponding invoice received.
    </li>
    <li>
      Events missing - An invoice has been received for this month that includes at least one service that there has been no measured data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unable to find rate - An error has occurred. An invoice has been received that includes at least one service that does not have a corresponding rate per transaction configured. Contact technical support to resolve this error.
    </li>
    <li>
      Invoice has unexpected charge - Event processing concludes there should be no charge for a particular service for a month (i.e. if all events had a charge Â£0.00), but the invoice charge is non-zero. In this case, event processing cannot compute a percentage discrepancy, as it would be infinite.
